# SwiftPay

A simple payment manager which automates the payment process upon entering specific zones.

## Our Vision

We believe that the payment process and making payments should be more efficient and convenient for all users.

We make payments fast and efficient by making them automatic. When a person passes by an event gate or toll booth, they are prompted to confirm a payment. Instead of stopping and reaching into their wallets to find money, people will be able to easily pay with the push of a button. We will use the TomTom geolocation API for event hosts and toll booths to set up payment areas.
